# Neural-Network-with-Z
This project mainly focuses on the neural network codes I have built during my learning journey in Deep Learning (DL). It will be continuously updated with new neural network models, including self-implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and others.
